# DOM-Element-Selector-using-HTML-and-JS

HTML Structure: The HTML file includes various elements like headings, paragraphs, and images, with specific ids and classes to facilitate selection.

JavaScript Code:

getElementById: Selects the heading by its id and changes its text content.

getElementsByClassName: Selects all paragraphs with the class text-content and changes their text color to blue.

querySelector: Selects the container div by its class name and changes its background color.

querySelectorAll: Selects all paragraphs inside the container div and updates their text content.

This assignment provides practice with different DOM selection methods and demonstrates how to manipulate styles and content of HTML elements using JavaScript.
